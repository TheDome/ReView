An unofficial ReMarkable viewing client written in Rust

This application is intended to show a live version of the Remarkable on your screen.

Additionally, this is my first try at Rust with GTK3.

# Function of this Application

This application is able to use the livesync feature of the ReMarkable Tablet. 
Currently only new lines will be shown and neither templates nor brushes are supported but I will change this in the future.
